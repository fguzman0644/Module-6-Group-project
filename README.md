## Guessing Program

This is a simple guessing game where the program generates a random number between 1 and 10, and the user tries to guess it. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, and congratulates the user when they guess correctly.

### How to Play

1. Run the program.
2. Enter your guess when prompted.
3. The program will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
4. If you guess correctly, you will be congratulated.
5. You can choose to play again or exit the game.
